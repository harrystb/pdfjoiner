# PDFJoiner
## Overview
Generates latex code to join two or more PDFs together then calls the pdflatex installed on the machine to generate the new PDF.

## Installation
Extract the executable from the release zip file. The executable is a portable version, and does not require an installation.

Due to the way that C# bundles dependencies for a single executable deployment, the actual files get extracted to a directory on the computer, for example on windows 10:

*C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local*

## Required Software
An installation of LaTeX is required to perform the joining of the PDF. There are several different implementations available, such as TexLive and MikTex.

## Usage
When the application is first run, the following window will be displayed.
